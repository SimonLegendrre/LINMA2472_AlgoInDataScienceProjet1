GA ND ALF (c on t'd ) (quietly)
Now, listen carefully. Lord Denethor is Boromir's father. To give him news of his beloved son's 
death would be most unwise
And do not mention Frodo . . . Or the

Ring
And say nothing of Aragorn either. (hesitates)
In fact, it's better if you don't speak at all, Pippin Took.

CLOSE ON: PIPPIN, suitably chastened, nods.

At the FOOT of the DAIS, in a small STONE CHAIR, sits an OLD MAN, gazing at his lap: DENETHOR - the 
Lord Steward of CONDOR.

GANDALF
Hail, Denethor, Son of Ecthelion, Lord and Steward of Gondor.

DENETHOR does not look up as GANDALF and PIPPIN approach.

PIPPIN drops to his knee offering DENETHOR his SWORD .

PIPPIN
I offer you my service, such as it is, in payment of this debt.

DENETHOR looks at PIPPIN blankly, overcome with grief.:

GANDALF
(to PIPPIN)



Get up!
(a ddre ssin g D ENET HOR)
My Lord, there will be a time to grieve for Boromir, but it is not now. War is coming
the Enemy is on your doorstep. As Steward, you are charged with the defence of this city. Where are

You still have friends — you are not alone in this fight. Send word to Theoden of Rohan. Light the 
beacons.

DENETHOR smiles at GANDALF, as if amused by something.

DENETHOR
(softly)
You think you are wise, Mithrandir, yet for all your subtleties.you have not wisdom. Do you think 
the eyes of the White Tower are blind? I have seen more than you know. With your left hand you 
would use me as a shield against Mordor and with your right you would seek to supplant me.

CLOSE ON: GANDALF looks shocked, DENETHOR'S eyes NARROW.

DENETHOR (cont'd) (contemptuous)
I know who rides with Theoden of Rohan. Oh, yes. Word has reached my ears of this Aragorn, son of 
Arathorn, and I tell you now, I will not bow to this Ranger from the North - last of a ragged 
house, long bereft of Lordship.

GANDALF
(stung)
Authority is not given to you to deny the return of the King - Steward!

DENETHOR

The rule of Condor is mine, and no others!

DENETHOR
Can you sing, Master Hobbit?

PIPPIN
(uneasy)
Well . . . yes, at least, well enough for my own people ... but we have no songs for great halls 
and evil times . . . we seldom sing of anything more terrible than wind or rain.

DENETHOR
And why should your songs be unfit for my halls, or for hours such as these. Come - sing me a song!

PIPPIN'S simple, clear voice echoes through the VAST HALL.

PIPPIN V/0
Home is behind, the world ahead, And there are many paths to tread.




Through shadow to the edge of night Until the stars are all alight.

THEODEN

The horses are restless . . quiet ..?


And the men are -;.

EOMER
They grow nervous in the shadow of the mountain . .

GIMLI'S eyes travel to a ROW of ANCIENT STANDING STONES that mark the ENTRANCE to a ROAD leading 
away from the ENCAMPMENT and INTO the MOUNTAIN.

GIMLI
That road there - where does that lead?

LEGOLAS

It is the road to the Dimholt ... under the mountain.
The door

ushers MERRY off.

EOWYN
To the Smithy .- go!

MERRY hurries off          EOMER watches the YOUNG HOBBIT leave.

EOMER
You should not encourage him.

EOWYN
And you should not doubt him.

EOMER




I do not doubt his heart ... of his arm.
Only the reach


CLOSE ON: GAMLING stifles a laugh . te

She stayed?

ELROND
She will not long survive the evil that now spreads from Mordor.

ELROND'S eyes fall to the EVENSTAR which hangs around ARAGORN'S neck . . .

ELROND (cont'd)
The light of the Evenstar is failing. As Sauron's power grows, her strength wanes. Arwen's life is 
now tied to the fate of the Ring. The Shadow is upon us, Aragorn, the end has come.

ARAGORN
It will not be our end, but his.



ELROND
You ride to war, but not to victory. Sauron's armies march on Minas Tirith — this you know - but in 
secret he sends another force which will attack from the river .

CLOSE ON: ARAGORN looks at ELROND in stock.

DIMHOLT ROAD . . .

ARAGORN looks at ELROND in shock . .


Murderers, traitors - you would call upon them to fight? They believe in nothing.
They answer to no-one.

They will answer to the King of Condor.




ARAGORN' S eyes fall to a PLAIN BLACK SCABBARD, which ELROND draws from beneath his robes.
